# Rust API for addressbook

An example API with more than one resource

## Overview

This client/server was generated by the [openapi-generator]
(https://openapi-generator.tech) project.  By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote
server, you can easily generate a server stub.

To see how to make this your own, look here:

This autogenerated project defines an API crate `addressbook` which contains:
* An `Api` trait defining the API in Rust.
* Data types representing the underlying data model.
* A `Client` type which implements `Api` and issues HTTP requests for each operation.
* A router which accepts HTTP requests and invokes the appropriate `Api` method for each operation.

It also contains an example server and client which make use of `addressbook`:

* The example server starts up a web server using the `addressbook`
    router, and supplies a trivial implementation of `Api` which returns failure
    for every operation.
* The example client provides a CLI which lets you invoke
    any single operation on the `addressbook` client by passing appropriate
    arguments on the command line.

You can use the example server and client as a basis for your own code.
See below for [more detail on implementing a server](#writing-a-server).

## Examples

Run examples with:

```
cargo run --example <example-name>
```

To pass in arguments to the examples, put them after `--`, for example:

```
cargo run --example client -- --help
```

### Running the example server
To run the server, follow these simple steps:

```
cargo run --example server
```

### Running the example client
To run a client, follow one of the following simple steps:

```
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyAddrtypeDelete
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyAddrtypeGet
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyAddrtypeHead
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyAddrtypePut
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyCityDelete
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyCityGet
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyCityHead
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyCityPut
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyCountryDelete
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyCountryGet
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyCountryHead
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyCountryPut
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyDelete
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyGet
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyHead
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyPatch
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyPersonUuidDelete
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyPersonUuidGet
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyPersonUuidHead
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyPersonUuidPut
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyPut
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyStateDelete
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyStateGet
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyStateHead
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyStatePut
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyStreetDelete
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyStreetGet
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyStreetHead
cargo run --example client AddressbookAddressKeyStreetPut
cargo run --example client AddressbookDelete
cargo run --example client AddressbookGet
cargo run --example client AddressbookHead
cargo run --example client AddressbookPatch
```

### HTTPS
The examples can be run in HTTPS mode by passing in the flag `--https`, for example:

```
cargo run --example server -- --https
```

This will use the keys/certificates from the examples directory. Note that the
server chain is signed with `CN=localhost`.

## Using the generated library

The generated library has a few optional features that can be activated through Cargo.

* `server`
    * This defaults to enabled and creates the basic skeleton of a server implementation based on hyper
    * To create the server stack you'll need to provide an implementation of the API trait to provide the server function.
* `client`
    * This defaults to enabled and creates the basic skeleton of a client implementation based on hyper
    * The constructed client implements the API trait by making remote API call.
* `conversions`
    * This defaults to disabled and creates extra derives on models to allow "transmogrification" between objects of structurally similar types.

See https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-features-section for how to use features in your `Cargo.toml`.
